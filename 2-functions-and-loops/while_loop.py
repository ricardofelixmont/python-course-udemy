# We can use while loop to repeat something a specific number os times:
i = 0   # control variable
while i < 10:
    print('{}Â° repetition'.format(i+1))
    i += 1  # Here we have to increment the control variable

# We can also use while loops to control some variable like temperature:
temperature = 15
while temperature < 20:
    print('Heating...')
    temperature += 1
